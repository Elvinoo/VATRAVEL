          <p>
            Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is the state
            located in the Caucasus region. Rich in oil, the country is located
            in Asia Transcaucasia, south of the mountainous watershed that
            separates it conventionally from Europe. Azerbaijan is the largest
            country in the Caucasus both in terms of area and population,
            bordering the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia
            and Armenia to the west, and Iran to the south. From geographic
            point of view, the State of Azerbaijan is not the European one,
            however, it is often considered as such thanks to historical and
            cultural considerations. In fact, Azerbaijan is a member of the
            Council of Europe. The country is also a member of the European
            Broadcasting Union (EBU) and therefore, it participates in the
            Eurovision Song Contest, won in 2011 and hosted the following year.
          </p>
          <h3 id="Hospitality">Hospitality</h3>
          <p>
            Guests are given the places of honor in the Azerbaijani traditions
            and treated with the utmost respect. Those who will have the
            opportunity to meet or stay with a family in Azerbaijan, definitely,
            they will see well-known Azerbaijani hospitality. The traditions of
            hospitality in Azerbaijan have come a long way; however, there are
            also modern manners that the families welcome the guests today. In a
            classical piece of Azerbaijani literature "Dede-Gorgud Dastani", it
            is said that "let the houses that no longer welcome guests
            collapse". There are considerable number of hotels of different
            types in Azerbaijan that can satisfy any visitor. Great number of
            hotels are situated in Baku, including budget and luxury hotels.

          <h3 id="Cuisine">Cuisine</h3>
          <p>
            As the main dishes, Azerbaijani cuisine has Plov with saffron aroma,
            coal-roasted kebabs, freshly-caught fish, sweet fruit and honey for
            dessert. The cuisine of Azerbaijan is full of flavours and surprises
            and is a vital part of the country and its culture. The flavours and
            ingredients used reflect the ingredients grown or available in
            Azerbaijan, although the commercial exchanges have brought new
            flavours from the entire world. Even the cooking techniques reflect
            the lifestyle and local traditions, and the names of the Azerbaijani
            dishes derive from the terms used in Azerbaijan. Hospitality is an
            important part of the Azerbaijani culture, and the cuisine is not an
            exception. Guests are treated to an abundance of dishes, and leaving
            food on the plate can be considered rude, even if you are already
            full. Food holds sacred place and sharing your food, even bread with
            another person creates a strong bond. Food culture is very rich. For
            example, the Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) and its central place in
            the Azerbaijani culture and among families have been recognized by
            the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Many dishes are delicious
            and healthy, which is why Azerbaijan is a country of centenarians.
            Beef and mutton are common, the same as poultry, fish, fruit and
            vegetables. The spices include dill, coriander, mint, chive and
            basil. They can be found in many of dishes, giving them rich and
            full flavours. The result is a wide variety of dishes that are
            hearty and nutritious, full of familiar and unusual flavours. But
            wait, that’s not all - there are endless foods to try in Azerbaijan.
            If you would like a hearty soup (like Piti) or a quick snack (like
            Kutab) or something to satisfy a sweet tooth (Pakhlava), you will
            find more to explore. The more you travel to Azerbaijan, the more
            you will discover, as every region (and every cook) has their own
            recipes that bring new flavours and delights

          <h3 id="Geography">Geography</h3>
          <p>
            Territory of the country covers the area of 86 600 km². It is
            located on the southern slopes of the Caucasus. Densely inhabited
            part of the country extends around the downstream of the Kura River
            that drains into the Caspian Sea, which washes the entire eastern
            part of Azerbaijan. The country borders Russia to the north, Armenia
            and Georgia to the west, and Iran to the south. Nakhchivan
            Autonomous Republic is enclosed between Armenia, Iran and Turkey.
            The capital is Baku city, and another important city is Ganja. The
            question whether Azerbaijan can be considered a transcontinental
            country lying on both sides of Asia and Europe is controversial.
            Having regarded the Kuma-Manych Depression as the natural boundary
            between Europe and Asia, the whole territory of Azerbaijan, in fact,
            would be on the Asian continent. If this border is along the
            Caucasian watershed or the Kura River and Rioni River, then a part
            of the Azerbaijani territory would be in Europe. Azerbaijan is
            mostly mountainous.

          <h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
          <p>
            In winter, the Greater Caucasus protects the country from polar
            influences, while summers are very hot. Towards the south from the
            capital instead, autumn is very rainy, while the rest of the country
            has a pleasant climate. 9 out of 11 climate zones are present in
            Azerbaijan.

          <h3 id="Population and Ethnicity">Population and Ethnicity</h3>
          <p>
            Population The current population of Azerbaijan is about 10 million.

          <h3 id="Ethnicity">Ethnicity</h3>
          <p>
            Azerbaijan is a multi-ethnic country. The population is mainly
            composed of Azerbaijanis (approximately 90%).
          </p>
          <h3 id="Language">Language</h3>
          <p>
            The official language is Azerbaijani, a Turkic language, written in
            Azerbaijani with the Latin alphabet, which replaced the Cyrillic
            alphabet. There is a small Russian-speaking minority (3.5%), Lezgi
            (1.9%) in the north and Talish (1.8%) in the south of the country.
            Obviously, as a legacy of the Soviet period, most of the Azerbaijani
            population speaks Russian fluently. Currently, majority of young
            people speak English well enough.
          </p>
          <h3 id="Political structure">Political structure</h3>
          <p>
            The structure of the political system in Azerbaijan was redefined by
            way of adoption of new Constitution on 12 November 1995. According
            to Article 23 of the Constitution, the state symbols of the Republic
            of Azerbaijan are the State Flag, the State Emblem and the State
            Anthem. The Government of Azerbaijan is based on the principle of
            separation of powers: legislative power, executive power and
            judicial power. Legislative power is exercised by the unicameral
            National Assembly (Milli Mejlis). Given the particular status of
            autonomy of Nakhchivan, powers, similar to those of the Milli
            Mejlis, are attributed to the Ali Mejlis of Nakhchivan Autonomous
            Republic. The executive power is vested in the President, who is
            elected for a seven-year term by way of direct election. The
            judicial power is exercised by the Constitutional Court, the Supreme
            Court and the courts of appeal, general courts and other specialised
            courts of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
